🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on historical data. Using Linear Regression, the model learns the relationship between features (like area, number of bedrooms, etc.) and the target variable (price).

The notebook walks through the full pipeline of:

Data collection & preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Building & training a linear regression model

Evaluating model performance

Making predictions on new data

🎯 Objectives

Understand the basics of Linear Regression.

Explore how different features impact house prices.

Build a simple yet effective predictive model.

Learn how to evaluate regression performance using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

🚀 How to Run

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Navigate to House_price_prediction_using_Linear_Regression_.ipynb.

Run all cells step by step to see data preprocessing, model training, and results.

📊 Results

The model fits a linear regression line to the training data.

You can visualize how predicted prices compare with actual prices.

Performance is measured using R² score and MSE.

📈 Future Improvements

Try other regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees).

Perform hyperparameter tuning.

Deploy the model using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit for a web app.

Use larger, real-world datasets for more accurate predictions.
